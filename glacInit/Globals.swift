//TODO for the project
//refactorization - bring globals here for a starter, and make code easier to follow
// error checking, not implemeneted in the filedownlaods
// completion handler for files
// switch mantiance
// hidden objects still have to be dealt with
// smaller view for the picker view would be nice
// custom objects not being hardcoded into place.

//Questions that arise
//do we assume everyone will have the same size Ipad or will it be modular? if so will need to refactor (more for if others are planning on using it
//Standardization if refactored/ we will need to create a standard that everything will be reformatted to, like 600 by 400 regardless of screen size
//export button will need to be updated where it checks if account is connected if not will will reprompt user to connect
